# Recommendations-with-IBM
This is a project in the Udacity Data Science course, where I am trying to use Matrix factorization for recommendations to be used in different situations.

In this notebook, I will be putting my recommendation skills to use on real data from the IBM Watson Studio platform.

By following the table of contents, I will build out a number of different methods for making recommendations.

# Table of Contents
- I. Exploratory Data Analysis
- II. Rank Based Recommendations
- III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
- IV. Content Based Recommendations (EXTRA - NOT REQUIRED)
- V. Matrix Factorization
- VI. Extras & Concluding
